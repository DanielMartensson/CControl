# CControl

CControl is a library written in 100% ANSI C (C89) code. The CMake project standard is set to `C17`.
The purpose with this library is to fit advanced tools for really small embedded systems or desktop as well.
Here I have focused on practical numerical methods and selected the methods that works best in practice. It has
been a lot of work finding the best methods and best algorithms.

# CLAPACK, Math Kernel Library, FFTPACK support

This library have different types of libraries. First library is the internal lightweight library that suits small embedded systems. The second library is higher lever library for larger matrices. The third library is libraries that are hardware independent. Set this as your math library inside `defines.h` file. The Math Kernel Library is extremely optimized and it's suitable for operative systems such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS meanwhile the lightweight library or CLAPACK and FFTPACK is suitable for an Arduino, STM32, PIC etc because they are 100% portable. The internal library is suited for really small devices.

## Model Predictive Control with integral action and Kalman-Bucy filtering

I have an old Weller WECP-20 that have seen better Days. I decided to give it new life by replacing the old analog AC PCB circuit that was
using a simple PI-controller + a triac to Control the heat inside the soldering tip. The soldering handle of the Weller WECP-20 was replaced with a JBC handle because I find JCB tips much better than old Weller tips. 

I replaced the PCB circuit with a new modern PCB circuit and implemented a Model Predictive Control with integral action and Kalman-Bucy filtering (Linear Quadratic Estimator, LQE) onto the microcontroller of the PCB circuit. The Weller WECP-20 has now a STM32 microcontroller.

The microcontroller is a STM32F051R8 has the following properties:

* ARM®Cortex®-M0 32-bit RISC core
* 48 MHz CPU
* 64 kB in Flash
* 8 kB in SRAM
* 12-bit ADC
* 32-bit PWM
* USART

This is the feedback. It could control the temperature much faster if the transformer could give about 100W-150W i power. The original transformer of Weller WECP-20 is a 50W transformer. The most important thing here is that the Model Predictive Controller is working perfectly! It was not so difficult to implement by the way. Once you have the state space model, the tuning of other parameters was easy.

## Fan Controller with Linear Quadratic Integral Control

I have created a controller for a fan. The controller works as it read the temperature sensor and it compare the temperature sensor with the potentiometer, which is the reference set point. If the error is large between the temperature sensor and the potentiometer, then the fan is going to turn on high, or low, depending on if the error is negative or positive. 

The goal with this system is that I'm going to implement this on a heat source. The fan is going to blow warm air onto a object and the object is holding the temperature sensor. If the fan is blowing to much warm air, then the controller is going to turn down the speed of the fan so the temperature of the object meets the reference

I have been using Matavecontrol and Mataveid to estimate and creating the kalman gain matrix and the LQR control law with integral action. I'm the author of both Matavecontrol and Mataveid.

## Model Predictive Integral Temperature Controller

This is a Model Predictive Controller, with integral action. It uses linear programming instead of quadratic programming for the optimization. This controller works well.

This predictive controller have a wiring diagram if you want to build the same controller for your temperature project.
